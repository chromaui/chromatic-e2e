# Test Archiver for Standalone Snapshots

Chromatic **Standalone Snapshots** is a feature that allows you to use the full Chromatic **UI Tests** and **UI Review** features with pages visited during end-to-end tests in Playwright.

You can use use Standalone Snapshots to capture live ‚Äúarchives‚Äù of pages either at the end of all tests, at specific points of your tests, or both. An **archive** is a self-contained, re-renderable HTML ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of your page at a certain point in time extracted from the Playwright driven browser‚Äôs DOM.

Those archives are then passed to Chromatic‚Äôs normal build process, which screenshots those archives in parallel in whichever cloud browsers you like, compares the output, and presents you with the changes to review.

Additionally, the archives you create during each test run can be viewed in a Storybook UI, which means you can inspect them on [chromatic.com](http://chromatic.com) after each build to more closely debug changes and errors.

## Installation

Get started by installing the archiver package, and the archive storybook:

```bash
yarn add --dev @chromaui/test-archiver @chromaui/archive-storybook
```

## Configuration

To create archives during playwright tests, import `test` and `expect` from `@chromaui/test-archiver`:

```tsx
import { test, expect } from '@chromaui/test-archiver';

// and use as normal
test('...', async ({ page }) => {
  expect(/* things */);
});
```

Once the above is configured, Chromatic will archive the final state of every test you run irrespective of whether it passes or fails.

### Manual snapshots

To take manual snapshots at specific points of your tests, you can use the `takeArchive` function inside your test runs:

```tsx
import { test, expect, takeArchive } from '@chromaui/test-archiver';

test('my test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Each time you call takeArchive, we add another archive to your Storybook
  await takeArchive(page, testInfo);

  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();

  // So you can call it several times, as necessary
  // To help disambiguate, you can give it a name
  await takeArchive(page, 'After clicking link', testInfo);
});
```

üí° Note that we‚Äôll always take an archive at the end of every test, in addition to the ones you manually specify.

## Setting up a Chromatic project

Whenever you run your Playwright test suite, archives will be created stored in `./test-archives/latest` (you can change that location with settings, see below). Those archives will automatically be integrated in the Archive Storybook installed above (see below on how to run that locally).

To test the Archive Storybook alongside your regular Storybook on every commit, you can setup a second Chromatic project using our monorepo support.

### Create a second project

First, head to [chromatic.com](http://chromatic.com), browse to your account and choose ‚ÄúAdd Project‚Äù, from there, choose your repository a second time:

<img width="417" alt="Chromatic Project Chooser" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132554/231355192-78a041d2-a552-4e88-b53f-20cafbb76f5f.png">

Choose a name for your second project, like ‚ÄúEnd to End Test Archives‚Äù:

<img width="625" alt="Creating a second Project" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132554/231355208-1ee68dfc-f585-421c-833d-c33a6f84ca52.png">

### Run Chromatic on the archives manually

Add the scripts for running the archive storybook to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "archive-storybook": "archive-storybook",
  "build-archive-storybook": "build-archive-storybook"
}
```

Now you can try running Chromatic against the archives with the project you just created manually:

```bash
npx chromatic --build-script-name=build-archive-storybook -t=<TOKEN>
```

### Run Chromatic on the archives in CI

Next, set up your CI service to run Chromatic a second time on each commit. The second `chromatic` run should use the project token from the new project you created above, and should use the `--build-script-name=build-archive-storybook` flag:

```yaml
// For instance in our github action:
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: yarn

  # üëá Runs Chromatic as normal for your Storybook
  - name: Publish to Chromatic
    uses: chromaui/action@v1
    with:
      projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}

  # üëá Runs your E2E tests
  - name: E2E tests
    run: yarn playwright test

  # üëá Runs Chromatic for your E2E test archives
  - name: Publish E2E Archives to Chromatic
    uses: chromaui/action@v1
    # Chromatic GitHub Action options
    with:
      # üëá This is the token for the second project
      projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
      buildScriptName: build-archive-storybook
```

Once you‚Äôve setup the above (or similar for your CI provider) and pushed a commit, you should see a build with your archive‚Äôs screenshots appear on the new project.

## Running the Storybook locally

If you want to debug your test archives locally, you can run the archive storybook as well.

First run the E2E tests to generate the latest results

```bash
yarn playwright test # or similar
```
> The `--headed` flag displays your tests in the browser as they run, which can be another helpful tool for debugging.

Then you can run the archive storybook with the `archive-storybook` command, and visit it like any other Storybook:

```bash
yarn archive-storybook
```

## Sharded Playwright Runs

When running your playwright tests over multiple shared CI jobs, you‚Äôll need to wait for all jobs to complete, ensure you save the results in `./test-archives` to be accessible by the next job (for instance using an [artifact in GH actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)), and run Chromatic for the archive storybook in a job that depends on all of the shards.

For GitHub actions, that might look like:

```yaml
test:
  name: Run Playwright
  needs: install
  strategy:
    matrix:
      shard: [1, 2]
  steps:
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ strategy.job-total }}

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: playwright-report-${{ matrix.shard }}_${{ strategy.job-total }}
        path: ./test-archives/latest
        retention-days: 30

chromatic:
  name: Run Chromatic
  needs: test
  steps:
    - name: Download all workflow run artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3

    - name: Publish E2E Archives to Chromatic
      uses: chromaui/action@v1
      with:
        projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
        buildScriptName: build-archive-storybook
```

## Extra Configuration

You can further configure things in the following way:

- To override the archive location, set the `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` environment variable, both when running your Playwright tests and when starting the Storybook (or publishing it in on CI).
